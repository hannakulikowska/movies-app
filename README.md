# Movies App

Movie Info App is a dynamic web application designed to fetch and display detailed information about movies. This project leverages the powerful TMDB API to provide up-to-date and comprehensive movie details.

## Features

* Proxy Server: To comply with best practices and overcome cross-origin restrictions, this application includes a custom proxy server. The proxy server fetches data from the TMDB API and securely relays it to the client-side application.
* Dynamic Loading UI: While data is being fetched from the server, users are greeted with a sleek loader animation. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback during data retrieval processes.
* Persistent Data: Utilizing LocalStorage, the application saves user preferences and data locally to enhance performance and user experience on subsequent visits.

## Stack

* Vite
* React
* TypeScript
* SCSS
* Mantine: A modern React component library used to design responsive and accessible UI components effortlessly.
